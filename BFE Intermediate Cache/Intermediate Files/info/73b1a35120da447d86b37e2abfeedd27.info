description = "A little mod I made by request.\r\n\r\nSoviet Combat Engineers can now build DShK-38 MG emplacements for 150MP/80Mu.\r\nOKW Sturmpioneers can now build MG 42 Concrete Bunkers (CoH1 style!) for 200MP/60Mu.\r\nBritish Sappers can now build Vickers K MG emplacements for 200MP/60Mu. Unlike other British emplacements, these don't have the Brace ability, don't get a bonus from the Forward Assembly, don't get veterancy and can't be garrisoned. With the Advanced Emplacement Regiment, they can be built by Tommies as well, but they don't get the Improved Fortifications (durability) upgrade. They are affected by the Royal Engineer Regiment's Stand Fast ability (global auto-repair), though.\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\nBetter descriptions and help texts.\r\nSome minor weapon and health balancing.\r\nMAYBE turning the British MG emplacement into a \"proper\" emplacement with all the bells and whistles. Might be totally OP, though!"
